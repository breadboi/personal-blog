# Brett Carney

Hello, I'm a Software Engineer and Musician. I enjoy leaning new technologies, tinkering away on side projects, and challenging myself in learning new musical instruments.

This portfolio is meant to be a vehicle me to share the things I've worked on and inspire others to pursue their own projects and challenges.
